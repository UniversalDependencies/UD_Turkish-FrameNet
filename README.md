# Introduction

Turkish FrameNet  consists of 2700  manually annotated sentences and 19221 tokens. The corpus is taken from the Turkish FrameNet Project where the Turkish verbs were annotated according to their semantic arguments. The sentences are like dictionary examples, they include made-up full sentences created by native speakers of Turkish.  

The corpus is divided into 139 semantic frames according to the verb meaning. The number of sentences in frames varies according to how many verbs Turkish language has in that category. Each frame has its own dev, test, and training files.
